VimeoGrabber
============

Minimalist chrome plugin which makes it easier to download "secured" vimeo videos.

Put Chrome in developer mode, load this directory as an unpacked extension, and enable it. Loading a vimeo
video will also open the video file url naked in a tab which can be easily saved with command-S. Easier than
watching the network dev tools and opening the tab manually.

This is not a sophisticated tool; disable it when you aren't grabbing content.
